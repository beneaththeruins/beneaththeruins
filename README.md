*~~i like nos astra a lot~~*

**HI!!** wsg. dx severe social anxiety, plsss be patient w/ me.
   - call me ethan! (or check my prns page if u wanna for names lol)
   - i use any/all! i'm more masc online, yes.
   - i like a lot of stuff!! mainly very nerdy things
   - i'm pretty chill about EVERYTHING!!!!! i have no "set in stone" dni, i just block and unfollow freely. i do prefer interacting with 16+ and under 20, however!
   - *please* don't take unfollows/unfriends as a personal offense!!!!! i do this a LOT, and i see basically everyone as a friend anyway so if it makes you more comfortable i'm perfectly fine friending again and explaining why i may have done such in the first place ^^' (i can guarentee it's probably because i was being stupid like genuinely i always explain if it's because i disagree with someone's actions/opinions)
   - i GREATLY value people's opinions of me, as i am a *massive* people pleaser. if find out i've hurt you in some way, i'm likely to do all i can to make it up to you :(

i play a lot of ponytown! that's where you'll see me most active.
   - ALWAYS feel free to hide behind or sit with me!!! (touch comf)
   - my statuses (busy/online/away/whateva) never mean a lot. i'm ok being approached regardless of them!!! unless my char is like. literally sleeping it's safe to say i'm online in some way LOLL tho oftentimes afk :p
