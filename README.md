*~~i like nos astra a lot~~*

**HI!!** wsg. dx severe social anxiety, plsss be patient w/ me.
   - call me ethan! (or check my prns page if u wanna for names lol)
   - i use any/all! i'm more masc online, yes.
   - i like a lot of stuff!! mainly very nerdy things
   - i'm pretty chill about basically everything! i have no "set in stone" dni, i just block and unfollow freely. i do prefer interacting with 16+ and under 20 however.
   - (please don't take unfollows as a personal offense)

i play a lot of ponytown! that's where you'll see me most active.
   - always feel free to hide behind or sit with me! (touch comf)
   - my statuses (busy/online/away/whateva) never mean a lot. i'm ok being approached regardless of them!!! unless my char is like. literally sleeping it's safe to say i'm online in some way LOLL tho oftentimes afk :p
